Muhammad Talal Aqdas	Team Leader,Github Repo Owner,Calculator Developer
Sarim Farooq Khan	Collaborator,Number Guessing Game Developer
# Description
This project is a collaborative Python project demonstrating simple programs while practicing GitHub version control. The project contains two main programs:
1.A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication,and division.Developed by Muhammad Talal Aqdas.
2.A number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.Developed by Sarim Farooq Khan.
The project demonstrates collaboration,branching,merging,and managing changes using GitHub.
# Working
The calculator asks the user to input two numbers and then performs all basic arithmetic operations,showing the results.Division by zero is handled with a message.
The number guessing game randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.The user guesses until they get it correct,receiving hints (“Too high” or “Too low”) and a count of attempts.After finishing,the user can choose to play again.
Both programs are simple and beginner-friendly,written without functions(except imports where required) and with clear,straightforward logic.
# Execution Instructions
1.Clone the repository using the GitHub link.
2.Open the .py file containing both programs in any Python IDE(Visual Studio Code,PyCharm,or IDLE).
3.Run the code and follow the on-screen instructions.
# Team Collaboration
The team leader(Talal) created the repository and managed branches.
Both members worked on separate branches(feature-calculator and feature-guessing) and then created pull requests to merge their work into the main branch.
Branches were merged on GitHub,ensuring no conflicts and both programs appeared in the final main file.
Evidence of commits,PRs,and merges is available in the GitHub repository.
#Usage of Git
Git was used to manage code changes and team collaboration:
Branches allowed each member to work independently.
Pull requests were used to merge features safely into the main branch.
Git tracked all commits,helping avoid conflicts and ensuring a smooth collaborative workflow.
Using Git is more efficient than manual file sharing because it tracks versions,allows easy merging,and reduces errors.
# Future Improvements
Add more mathematical functions to the calculator(square root,exponentiation,etc.).
Add a scoring system or difficulty levels to the guessing game.
Combine both programs into a menu-based application.

Combine both programs into a menu-based application.

Add persistent data storage (like saving scores or results to a file).
